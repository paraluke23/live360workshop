**PREVIEW capability** 

Automated ML now supports Azure Databricks as a local compute to perform training (**public preview**). Azure Databricks is a managed Spark offering on Azure and customers already use it for advanced analytics. It provides a collaborative Notebook based environment with CPU or GPU based compute cluster. 
- Customers who use Azure Databricks for advanced analytics can now use the same cluster to run automated machine learning experiments. 
- You can keep the data within the same cluster. 
- You can leverage the local worker nodes with autoscale and auto termination capabilities. 
- You can use multiple cores of your Azure Databricks cluster to perform simultenous training. 
- You can further tune the model generated by automated machine learning if you chose to. 
- Every run (including the best run) is available as a pipeline. 
- The model from the pipeline can be registered in Azure ML SDK workspace and then deployed to Azure managed compute (ACI or AKS) using the Azure Machine learning SDK.

**Create Azure Databricks Cluster:**

Select New Cluster and fill in following detail:
 - Cluster name: _yourclustername_
 - Cluster Mode: Any. **High Concurrency** preferred
 - Databricks Runtime: Any 4.x runtime.
 - Python version: **3**
 - Workers: 2 or higher.  
 - Max. number of **concurrent iterations** in Automated ML settings is **<=** to the number of **worker nodes** in your Databricks cluster.
 - Worker node VM types: **Memory optimized VM** preferred. 
 - Uncheck _Enable Autoscaling_


It will take few minutes to create the cluster. Please ensure that the cluster state is running before proceeding further.

**Install Azure ML with Automated ML SDK on your Azure Databricks cluster**

- Select Import library

- Source: Upload Python Egg or PyPI

- PyPi Name (_with_ Automated ML capability): **azureml-sdk[automl_databricks]**

- PyPi Name (_without_ Automated ML capability): **azureml-sdk[databricks]**

- Click Install Library

- Do not select _Attach automatically to all clusters_. In case you have selected earlier then you can go to your Home folder and deselect it.

- Select the check box _Attach_ next to your cluster name

(More details on how to attach and detach libs are here - [https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/libraries.html#attach-a-library-to-a-cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/libraries.html#attach-a-library-to-a-cluster) )

- Ensure that there are no errors until Status changes to _Attached_. It may take a couple of minutes.

**Note** - If you have the old build the please deselect it from clusterâ€™s installed libs > move to trash. Install the new build and restart the cluster. And if still there is an issue then detach and reattach your cluster.

**Now you can run the Automated ML sample notebook on your Azure Databricks cluster. Please let us know your feedback.**
